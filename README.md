Our world is a grid of squares of fixed size. The size of the squares is determined by `cellSize` variable. The amount
of squares is determined by `worldSize` variable. Naturally, the product `cellSize * worldSize` (has to!) yields the size of the 
map. 

Each unit has a `position`, which holds the information of the cell they are in. The variable `rect` contains their
actual position in the map.
