# global idea draft 

- We are a beginner ghostbuster. We start (tutorial level) with an exerienced one explaining us how to trap a ghost and talking about ghosts, and we end by saving the world?
- Next levels: haunted houses

# Characters

## ghosts (qhosts? gqosts? how to make them quantum lol?)
- want to survive and reproduce. or attack? or make some tricks?
- combine photons and virtual qubits properties:
  - |0> is none, |1> is one, |2> is two ghosts at the same spot etc.
  - they bunch: going through a mirror (?) work like a beam splitter: |1> -> |01> + |10> -> |001> +|010> + |100>, |1> and |1> from different directions give |20> + |02> etc.
  - |0> <-> |1> if X gate is applied
  - superposition collapses if a measurement gate is applied
- "reproduce" by going through mirrors: they are in more locations and are harder to find and trap
- shown as a ghost figure, or a couple of them
- can move towards ghostbuster and if they touch him, he gets minus health?
- can go through walls?
- several types?
    
## Protagonist
- a ghostbuster
- wants to trap ghosts
- can do it by using quantum gates
  - X to trap a ghost |n> -> |n-1>. Also, if there is a superposition |01>+|10>, application of X gives |00>+|11>, which teleports one ghost to another and they move essentially like |2>.
     Can be useful to move them closer to a player.
  - measurement: collapses a superposition, and thus only another |1> is left.
  - something else? more gates in meta-progression?

# levels

- level is ended when there is no more ghosts?

## tutorial

- special glasses that allow see the ghosts
- one ghost going directly at us, with a comment from the game
- then one ghost going through ghost-splitter that requires us to chase two of them

## real levels

- more ghosts
- more mirrors
- higher ghost speed?
- walls in weird positions?
